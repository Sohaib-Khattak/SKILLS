# LinkedIn Post Generation Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "write a LinkedIn post" or "create a social media post for my career"
- User mentions LinkedIn, professional networking, or personal branding
- User needs help creating short-form professional content

## Procedure

1.  **Clarify the Core Message**: Understand the main point, goal, and target audience for the post.
2.  **Draft a Strong Hook**: Write an engaging opening sentence that grabs attention.
3.  **Develop the Body**: Expand on the hook with 2-4 sentences or a short bulleted list. Provide value and insight.
4.  **Create a Call to Action (CTA)**: End with a question or a clear instruction to encourage engagement.
5.  **Suggest Hashtags**: Provide 3-5 relevant hashtags to increase visibility.

## Output Format

**Hook**: A compelling opening line.
**Body**: The main content, formatted for readability.
**Call to Action**: A concluding sentence to drive engagement.
**Hashtags**: A list of 3-5 relevant tags.

## Quality Criteria

-   **Hook**: Must be a question, a bold or contrarian statement, or a surprising fact. Avoid clichés.
-   **Body**: Content should be insightful, concise, and easy to scan. Use whitespace and simple language.
-   **Call to Action**: Must be direct and easy to follow (e.g., "What are your thoughts?", "Share your experience below.").
-   **Hashtags**: A mix of broad and niche tags relevant to the post's topic and industry.

## Example

**Input**: "Write a LinkedIn post about the importance of taking breaks to be more productive."

**Output**:
-   **Hook**: "Working longer hours does not equal getting more done. It often means the opposite."
-   **Body**: "Our brains aren't built for 8 straight hours of focused work. The most productive people I know don't just work hard; they recharge strategically. Stepping away for even 5 minutes can lead to a breakthrough."
-   **Call to Action**: "What's your favorite way to recharge during the workday? Let me know in the comments."
-   **Hashtags**: "#productvity #worklifebalance #mentalhealth #futureofwork #careeradvice"
