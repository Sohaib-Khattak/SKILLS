# 🔐 Alternative Posts Guidelines

This document outlines the procedure for handling requests to create posts for platforms or purposes **other than LinkedIn** (e.g., Twitter, Medium, blog posts, email newsletters, social media platforms, etc.).

## ⚠️ Permission Protocol

If a user requests a post with a title or specification that indicates a **non-LinkedIn platform or purpose**, you **MUST**:

### Step 1: Identify the Request
Recognize when the requested post is for:
- A different social media platform (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc.)
- A different publishing format (Blog post, Email newsletter, Medium article, etc.)
- A different audience context (Internal company memo, press release, etc.)
- Any title or description that deviates from "LinkedIn Post"

### Step 2: Ask for Explicit Permission
Before proceeding, respond with:

```
I notice you're requesting a [PLATFORM/FORMAT] post instead of a LinkedIn post.
This skill is specifically designed for LinkedIn content creation.

Do you want me to:
A) Create a LinkedIn version of this post instead, OR
B) Create the [PLATFORM/FORMAT] post anyway (I will adapt the format and tone accordingly)?

Please confirm your preference before I proceed.
```

### Step 3: Validate User Consent
Only proceed if the user:
- Explicitly confirms they want the alternative format
- Acknowledges this is outside the skill's primary scope
- Provides any additional platform-specific guidelines if needed

### Step 4: Adapt and Create
Once permission is granted:
- Maintain professionalism and quality standards
- Adapt the tone and structure to suit the target platform
- Note the platform/format at the beginning of the output
- Include a disclaimer: "⚠️ This post was created for [PLATFORM] and deviates from the LinkedIn post standard format."

## 📋 Examples of Alternative Requests

### Situation 1: Twitter Post Request
**User says:** "Create a post about data science in 280 characters"

**Your response:** Ask permission first using the protocol above.

### Situation 2: Blog Post Request
**User says:** "Write a detailed blog post about machine learning"

**Your response:** Ask permission first and clarify expectations.

### Situation 3: Email Newsletter Request
**User says:** "Create a newsletter content about AI trends"

**Your response:** Ask permission first and discuss newsletter structure.

### Situation 4: Internal Company Memo
**User says:** "Write a memo to the team about our new project skills"

**Your response:** Ask permission first and confirm company communication guidelines.

## ✅ When Permission is NOT Needed

You may proceed **without** asking for permission if:
- The user explicitly mentions LinkedIn or uses the phrase "LinkedIn post"
- The request uses the standard LinkedIn post format details
- The user confirms they want the original skill output
- The request is clearly within the LinkedIn-Post-Creator scope

## 🎯 Summary

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| LinkedIn post requested | ✅ Proceed directly |
| Alternative platform/format | ❓ Ask for permission first |
